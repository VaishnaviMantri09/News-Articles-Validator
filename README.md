# 🖼️ News Articles Validator

This project uses [Microsoft Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to automate a browser, navigate to [Hacker News - Newest](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest), and validate that the **first 100 articles** are sorted from **newest to oldest**.

## 🧭 What the Script Does ?
- Launches a headless browser using **Playwright**.
- Navigates webpage (https://news.ycombinator.com/newest).
- Validates the chronological order to ensure articles are sorted from newest to oldest.
- Logs results: success if the order is correct; an error with the position if not.

## 📋 Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [Microsoft Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
